QtDSO 0.1 (c) 2002 M.Toussaint

QtDSO is a simple frontend for the Velleman PCS64i digital oscilloscope.
It provides a fully featured oscillocope mode (including XY plot and math)
and a highly configurable spectrum analyzer mode. It has been tested with
the Velleman scope and didn't show problems here. If you encounter problems
with your scope at home, don't use QtDSO. I will not take ANY responsibility
on your hardware. 

QtDSO is kind of "works for me" software. I'm using it, I like it the way 
it is  and it seems  to be quite stable. It still needs some improvements 
but does it's job quite well.

QtDSO is distributed under the GNU Public License, version 2.

You'll find 3 'official' icon files for QtDSO in this directory:

- qtdso-16x16.xpm
- qtdso-32.32.xpm
- qtdso-48x48.xpm

The tab size of the sourcefiles is 2 

If someone want's to create RPM's, you are welcome. I will provide a download
link on my site.
