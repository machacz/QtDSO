Installation QtDSO 0.1 (c) 2002 M.Toussaint

Requirements:
-------------
- Qt library >= 2.1.0 <http://www.trolltech.com> thread version
- tmake (I think version >= 1.5 , but I'm not shure) <http://www.trolltech.com>
- Additionally you should have Qt-Designer installed (standard for current
  Qt version)
- A Velleman PCS64i digital oscilloscope
- libieee1284 <http://cyberelk.net/tim/data/libieee1284>
- libfftw_threads <www.fftw.org>

QtDSO will compile with both Qt-2.x and Qt-3.x. It was tested with Qt-2.3.2
and Qt-3.0.5.

Compilation:
------------
Make shure QTDIR is set correctly and tmake, moc and uic are installed. With
some of the major Linux distributions you have to install a qt-devel package
(or similar package name) in  order to get the header files for Qt, wich are
essential for the compilation.

Make shure that libiee1284 and libfftw_threads are installed. If not, grab
them at the above mentioned sites (or search through www.freshmeat.net) and
install. Both libraries compiled without any problems on my box. Installation
was without problems too. Please follow the instructions that came with these
libraries. I can not give you any support on that.

* tmake can be found at ftp://ftp.trollteech.com
* moc and uic  are part  of the original source  tarballs of Qt or  might be 
  hidden in a developer package of Qt for your distribution.

- untar the tarball you've downloaded
- enter the QtDSO directory
- type ./configure [--help] 
- type make 

That's it. You should have the executable qtdso (in QtDSO/bin) now.

If you encounter any problems don't hesitate to contact me
