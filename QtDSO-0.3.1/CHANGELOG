04/03/2007 0.3.1
           - Fixed missing Âµ character in the GUI
04/02/2007 0.3
           - Envelope mode
           - Internal cleanup and more complete API for DSO class
           - Fully dynamic interface (to reflect DSO's capabilities)
           - roughly calibrated delay in reading routine for PCS64i 
             (stopped working with a fast machine). Still needs more
             investigation. Velleman recomends reading/writing twice
             to give optocouplers the time they need. Unfortunately
             this lowers max framerate a lot.
           - double buffer for Vu-meter
           - simulator chrome
           - Software trigger stabilization for interpolating modes
           - 64MHz oversampling mode for PCS64i
           - Persistent settings
           - 4 digits for frequency display
           - fixed configure script
           - now compiles with gcc 4.x
26/07/2004 0.2
           - Converter histogram
           - fixed single shot / continous button behaviour
           - dc offset retrieval
           - simulator
24/07/2004 0.1.2
           - QtDSO from now on needs fftw3
19/07/2004 0.1.1
           - Make it compile cleanly with gcc 3.x and Qt 3.x
03/10/2002 0.1
           - Initial release version 0.1
